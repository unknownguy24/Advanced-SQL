-- Exercise 1
-- Select all records from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table such that there is at least one item in the order 
-- with an order quantity greater than 500. The individual items tied to an order can be found in the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail table.
-- Select the following columns:
-- PurchaseOrderID
-- OrderDate
-- SubTotal
-- TaxAmt
-- Sort by purchase order ID.


SELECT
       A.PurchaseOrderID
      ,A.OrderDate
      ,A.SubTotal
	  ,A.TaxAmt

FROM AdventureWorks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader A

WHERE EXISTS (
	SELECT
	1
	FROM AdventureWorks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail B
	WHERE A.PurchaseOrderID = B.PurchaseOrderID
		AND B.OrderQty > 500
)

ORDER BY 1


-- Exercise 2
-- Modify your query from Exercise 1 as follows:
-- Select all records from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table such that there is at least one item in the order 
-- with an order quantity greater than 500, AND a unit price greater than $50.00.
-- Select ALL columns from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table for display in your output.
-- Even if you have aliased this table to enable the use of a JOIN or EXISTS, 
-- you can still use the "SELECT *" shortcut to do this. Assuming you have aliased your table "A", 
-- simply use "SELECT A.*" to select all columns from that table.

SELECT
       A.*

FROM AdventureWorks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader A

WHERE EXISTS (
	SELECT
	1
	FROM AdventureWorks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail B
	WHERE A.PurchaseOrderID = B.PurchaseOrderID
		AND B.OrderQty > 500
		AND B.UnitPrice > 50
)

ORDER BY 1


-- Exercise 3
-- Select all records from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table such that NONE of the items within the order 
-- have a rejected quantity greater than 0.
-- Select ALL columns from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table using the "SELECT *" shortcut.


SELECT
       A.*

FROM AdventureWorks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader A

WHERE NOT EXISTS (
	SELECT
	1
	FROM AdventureWorks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail B
	WHERE A.PurchaseOrderID = B.PurchaseOrderID
		AND B.RejectedQty > 0
)

ORDER BY 1
