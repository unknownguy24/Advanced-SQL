-- Exercise 1
-- Create a query that displays all rows from the Production.ProductSubcategory table, and includes the following fields:
-- The "Name" field from Production.ProductSubcategory, which should be aliased as "SubcategoryName"
-- A derived field called "Products" which displays, for each Subcategory in Production.ProductSubcategory, 
-- a semicolon-separated list of all products from Production.Product contained within the given subcategory
-- Hint: Production.ProductSubcategory and Production.Product are related by the "ProductSubcategoryID" field.

SELECT 
       SubcategoryName = A.[Name]
	  ,Products =
		STUFF(
			(
				SELECT
					';' + B.Name

				FROM AdventureWorks2019.Production.Product B

				WHERE A.ProductSubcategoryID = B.ProductSubcategoryID

				FOR XML PATH('')

			),1,1,''
		)

  FROM AdventureWorks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory A



-- Exercise 2
-- Modify the query from Exercise 1 such that only products with a ListPrice value greater than $50 are listed in the "Products" field.
-- Hint: Assuming you used a correlated subquery in Exercise 1, keep in mind that you can apply additional criteria to it, 
-- just as with any other correlated subquery.
-- NOTE: Your query should still include ALL product subcategories, but only list associated products greater than $50. 
-- But since there are certain product subcategories that don't have any associated products greater than $50, 
-- some rows in your query output may have a NULL value in the product field.
