-- Exercise 1
-- Use a recursive CTE to generate a list of all odd numbers between 1 and 100.
-- Hint: You should be able to do this with just a couple of slight tweaks to the code from our first example in the video.

WITH Odds AS
(
SELECT
 1 AS MyOddNumber

UNION  ALL

SELECT 
MyOddNumber + 2
FROM Odds
WHERE MyOddNumber < 99
)

SELECT
MyOddNumber
FROM Odds


-- Exercise 2
-- Use a recursive CTE to generate a date series of all FIRST days of the month (1/1/2021, 2/1/2021, etc.)
-- from 1/1/2020 to 12/1/2029.
-- Hints:
-- Use the DATEADD function strategically in your recursive member.
-- You may also have to modify MAXRECURSION.
