-- Exercise 1
-- Create a query with the following columns:
-- “OrderMonth”, a derived column featuring the month number corresponding with the Order Date in a given row
-- “OrderYear”, a derived column featuring the year corresponding with the Order Date in a given row
-- “SubTotal” from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table
-- Your query should be an aggregate query – specifically, it should sum “SubTotal”, 
-- and group by the remaining fields.

-- Exercise 2
-- Modify your query from Exercise 1 by adding a derived column called "Rolling3MonthTotal", 
-- that displays - for a given row - a running total of “SubTotal” for the prior three months (including the current row).
-- HINT: You will need to include multiple fields in your ORDER BY to get this to work!

-- Exercise 3
-- Modify your query from Exercise 2 by adding another derived column called "MovingAvg6Month", 
-- that calculates a rolling average of “SubTotal” for the previous 6 months, 
-- relative to the month in the “current” row. Note that this average should NOT include the current row.

-- Exercise 4
-- Modify your query from Exercise 3 by adding another derived column called “MovingAvgNext2Months”, 
-- that calculates a rolling average of “SubTotal” for the month in the current row 
-- and the next two months after that. This moving average will provide a kind of "forecast" for Subtotal by month.
