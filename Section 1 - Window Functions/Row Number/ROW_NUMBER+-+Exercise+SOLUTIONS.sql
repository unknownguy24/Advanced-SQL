-- Exercise 1
-- Create a query with the following columns:
-- “Name” from the Production.Product table, which can be aliased as “ProductName”
-- “ListPrice” from the Production.Product table
-- “Name” from the Production.ProductSubcategory table, which can be aliased as “ProductSubcategory”
-- “Name” from the Production.ProductCategory table, which can be aliased as “ProductCategory”
-- *Join Production.ProductSubcategory to Production.Product on “ProductSubcategoryID”
-- **Join Production.ProductCategory to ProductSubcategory on “ProductCategoryID”
-- All the tables can be inner joined, and you do not need to apply any criteria.
